What is Bitcoin Confidential?

An open source, decentralized privacy platform built for global person to person eCommerce.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Confidential Core software, see https://www.bitcoinconfidential.cc/.


Getting Started

A new BitcoinC wallet will need an HD master key loaded and an initial account
derived before it will be functional.

The GUI programs will guide you through the initial setup.

It is recommended to use a mnemonic passphrase.
To generate a new passphrase see the mnemonic rpc command.
Loading the new mnemonic with the extkeyimportmaster command will setup the
master HD key and first account.

To create an initial new HD master key and account from random data, start
bitcoincd or bitcoinc-qt with the parameter: -createdefaultmasterkey.

Remember to backup your passphrase and/or wallet.dat file!
